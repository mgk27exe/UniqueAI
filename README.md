NLP, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Deep Learning.

Hi everyone,
  I am starting my artificial intelligence development adventure using NLP, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Deep Learning. It will be a long and tiring process.

  My project will focus on natural language processing (NLP) in the first place so it can answer my questions.

In the second stage of my project, image processing (IP) will be the subject, so that it can process pictures and draw pictures according to our wishes, such as MidJourney.

  First of all, deep learning libraries (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras etc.) will be available for these topics. I use these libraries because they include very popular models in areas such as applying artificial intelligence algorithms, image processing and natural language processing (NLP).

  In the last stage, there will be data collection and cleaning issues in my project. It's data because it's a fundamental element for building the right algorithms and training the model.

  I hope to finish my project, which will be like this, by taking trainings and working on it intensively. I hope it will be useful for you.

Kind regards,
Muhammed Gorkem Kilic
